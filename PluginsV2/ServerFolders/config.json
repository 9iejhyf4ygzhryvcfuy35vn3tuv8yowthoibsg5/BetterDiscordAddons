		"description": "Adds the feature to create folders to organize your servers. Right click a server > 'Serverfolders' > 'Create Server' to create a server. To add servers to a folder hold 'Ctrl' and drag the server onto the folder, this will add the server to the folderlist and hide it in the serverlist. To open a folder click the folder. A folder can only be opened when it has at least one server in it. To remove a server from a folder, open the folder and either right click the server > 'Serverfolders' > 'Remove Server from Folder' or hold 'Del' and click the server in the folderlist. \n\nMy Support Server: http://bit.ly/DevilBrosHaus or https://discordapp.com/invite/Jx3TjNS"
